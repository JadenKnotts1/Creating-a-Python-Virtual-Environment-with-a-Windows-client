<br />
Go to file directory where you want to store your VME and copy that file directory path: <br/>

<br />
<br />
From the CLI we need to copy directory (cd) to create the VME in that file directory :  <br/>

<br />
<br />
we can double check the file was created by typing "dir":  <br/>

<br />
<br />
next we move to the directory we created and activate the virtual environment:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
we  can also deactivate the virtual environment:  <br/>
